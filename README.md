<p>ð–¥” [ * Pronouns are <b>they/vial/ink/+</b>. ]</p>
<p>ð–¥” I'm a <b>digital art SFW artist!</b> I'm an asian. I love interacting with a lot of people, everyone is welcome as long as they obtain a friendship and become supportive!</p>
<p>ð–¥” <b>I don't share personal information if we just met.</b> I'm also <b>uncomfortable with feminine nicknames</b> such as babygirl, mamacita, and so on unless you're an exception</p>
<p>ð–¥” I'm random on ponytown when I feel like it, so find me in the sonic spot! I'll get along with you <b>carefully</b> if we just met.</p>
